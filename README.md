I am Jason, Xiaotian Dou, in Information Science, as a master student,

I am interested in data analysis problem related to social science, a recent lterature studying the censorship behavior of CHinese government on the internet, specially containing text analysis.

Gary King's study on is says that Chinese government tend to focus on censoring comment has the potential to invoke collective behavior instead of critical comments.This is conterintuitive but also understandable.
