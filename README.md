I am Jason, Xiaotian Dou, in Information Science, as a master student. I am generally interested in the area of computational social science.

I am interested in data analysis problem related to social science, a recent lterature studying the censorship behavior of CHinese government on the internet, specially containing text analysis.

Gary King's study http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/experiment_0.pdf on it says that Chinese government tend to focus on censoring comment has the potential to invoke collective behavior instead of critical comments.This is conterintuitive but also understandable.

The data analysis includes using collection of social media post before and after censorship is conducted. The collection of social media text data includes weibo(Chinese twitter) and self-build websites.

a picture show how the oberservational result look like.
